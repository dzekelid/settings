      description: |-
        Get information about all the products (things that can be booked) offered.
         3 types of product are available:
         - fixed are products with a fixed schedule and a given number of seats. Ex a group tour, a class, a workshop
         - fixedCourse are fixed products that are defined as a course, i.e. comprise of a series of dates
         - flexibleTime are products that describe private appointments, i.e. when one booking uses one resource (teacher, consultant, etc)

         Although Bookeo applies a minimum amount of caching, it is recommended to cache these results for 10-15 minutes to improve the performance of your application, as product settings change rarely.
